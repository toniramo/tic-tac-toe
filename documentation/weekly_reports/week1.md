# Week 1 (draft)

Done:
- Set up project
- Study minimax and trying to figure out how to apply it to large scale tic-tac-toe. 

Raising questions:
- About implementing the AI: In a large game (5 in row, large board) it is not reasonable to go through each possible move with minimax so some heuristic is needed to limit the needed search depth.
  - What kind of heuristic could be applied? How to determine the likelyhood of winning if it cannot be achieved within N moves.
