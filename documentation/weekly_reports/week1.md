# Week 1 (draft)

Done:
- Set up project
  - Basic files and configuration
  - Additional: checkstyle, Github actions
  - Took surprisingly long time (couple of hours)
- Study minimax and trying to figure out how to apply it to large scale tic-tac-toe. 

Raising questions:
- About implementing the AI: In a large game (5 in row, large board) it is not reasonable to go through each possible move with minimax so some heuristic is needed to limit the needed search depth.
  - What kind of heuristic could be applied? How to determine the likelyhood of winning if it cannot be achieved within N moves.

Comments:
- It was not mandatory to use e.g. checkstyle (I suppose) but I wanted to practice setting up a project like teached in "ohjelmistotekniikka" course. Though, I tried to figure out first just with Google needed configuration but soon noticed that my old projects and course materials gave much help as well.

## Temporary notes

Example questions for report: 

>    What have you done this week?
>    
>    How has the project progressed?
>    
>    What did you learn this week / today?
>    
>    What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.
>    
>    What next?
